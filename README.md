For the demo application we created a blog app application. We used CRUD functionality to be able to create, delete, update and edit articles. The application also includes a login and register page. Only users that are logged in can see the articles, update, edit and delete them. 

Our application uses unit tests to make sure the code runs properly. Unit tests are run on both the routes and models. A in-memory database is used in the project to use for the tests.Using a separate database for the tests to prevent interference with the actual database. In the application, we also created a user for the test to work test the routes that need an authorized user.
